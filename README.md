# GSO-Simu
GSO Pet &amp; Stone upgrade simulator

This simulator is meant to simulate leveling pets in Grow Stone Online, as well as upgrading stone x to stone y.
It will display valuable information such as gold, essence, blessings, favors, and total attempts required to reach your level desired.

Stone simulation will simulate the number of stone x required to reach stone y with a given super combination success rate.
It will display the number of stone x and what your actual super combination percentage was for that particulat simulation.


Pet level simulation is currently completed. If you find any bugs or errors in the code, please let me know.
Stone simulation is currently under development.
